# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is a kind-of fun project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is an age old game where two competitors use their fingers to make the shape of rock, paper or scissor.
In project page(https://arupduttabappy.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor/) you can enjoy it too. Your opponent will be a competitive A.I. player(!)
who never gives up.
Best of luck!
